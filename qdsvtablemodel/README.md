QDsvTableModel
==============

Qt/C++ class for reading and writing CSV (Comma-Separated Values), TSV(Tab-Separated Values), and other DSV(Delimiter-Separated Values) files. 


QDsvTableModel is based on QAbstractTableModel and from my blog "Dealing With CSV Files: The Easy Way" (http://qtsimplify.blogspot.com/2013/02/dealing-with-csv-files-easy-way.html). QDsvTableModel is still under development, but it is already usable.
